# Dataset

The **_USER_** folders contain the original files from the MOBISIG data record. The **_persistenthomology_** folder contains the
corresponding barcode diagrams, as well as all persistence diagrams, calculated on a Rips-Vietoris complex. The corresponding
diagrams are saved into a `.npy` file. In the **_natneighbor_** folder there is a special interpolation of each data set with
the method of the nearest natural neighbor. The interpolation was performed 0 to 4 times. Further data is added continuously.
